# Physiotherapy

is shockingly hard to reach. A surgeon explained it to me in 5 minutes. It's expensive and so the state grants every person max 45 mins/week. They look at a CMD person, realize that they will need to pay for a wheelchair and maybe a car, and so why bother paying for therapy, when in the end the diagnosis is that the disease progressive and debilitating and even fatal?
Very realistic, and very straightforward. It was as good to hear it straight in my face as it was shocking.

So if you are in DK and you/your child need more therapy than 45 mins a week (if you can even find a therapist that would do that), you need to pay the extra time from your pocket. Yes, evern after paying your 50% tax. In some municipalities this theory works. In Aarhus it doesnot, because there is no way to pay to have your child treated in the Borneterapien in Marselisborg. You can take your 4 year old to a grim therapy in adult physio, but that's not going to do much for her/him.

Vivienne has had up to 4 hours of therapy with NDIS in Australia, because she responds well to it. She did start walking after doing Vojta therapy for 3 months in CZ, and maintains well with DNS. But it needs dynamic adjustment and a team of practitioners, not just a grumpy mother, who feels very alone being the only one doing it. 

But even the basic physio is hard to reach in DK. I have spent most of 2019 justifying the need for regular physiotherapy despite evidence 2 inch deep. My goal was to make exercising part of Vivienne's life just like in Oz. In Oz, physio is *not* a big deal. Bodies wear down with age, so everyone needs it eventually. It's a mass product, you are supposed to want it and specialised sports doctors and body-coaches are abundant. In DK, the therapists are here for people who need to recover function after broken limbs or because of age. They are surprised to see a well trained 30-40-year old asking for help with a specific muscle group and struggle to find suitable treatment. I can google the same basic suggestions myself. 
I have not found a sports doctor used to stress injuries. Therapists seem much less focused on the physical as much as the emotional and overall wellbeing. Their suggestion when I asked for help with my wrist pain or back pain was to find an assistant and relief from doing it myself. 
Great, thanks.
